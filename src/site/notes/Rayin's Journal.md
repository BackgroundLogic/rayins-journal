### Hello Reader, 
My name is Rayin Cnaimhin, I am a hunter by trade with some small ability to foresee events. A recent vision warning of some danger has sent me on a quest to visit the City of Ashtar atop the plateau of Andorra.  Let this journal serve as a chronicle my adventures in and around The Planes while I investigate this vision and try to find its meaning.
