### Beginning of Spring Nerell 1st week of Thallo
After a week of preparation I have finally left home for Ashtar. The vision I glimpsed on my last hunt indicates something that could lead to widespread danger effecting even remote corners of the planes like my village, I can only hope that I will receive clearer visions as I get closer to whatever this danger in Ashtar is. 

After a month of travel I have arrived in the foothills of the Plateau of Andorra, the trek up the plateau will likely take all day so I've decided to use the rest of today's light to hunt and set camp. I managed to hunt a decent rabbit more than I'd needed for just myself luckily a chatty elf with light purple skin by the name of LahVander approached wanting a chant. I shared my rabbit with the strange fellow unfortunately for them I accidentally burned the rabbit (nat 1 survival roll, first roll of the game). 

### First Day in Ashtar - Maruk 1st week of Pherusa
The next morning we broke our fast with a bit of leftover burnt rabbit and some rations before departing for Ashtar. This is the first time I have ever seen a settlement this large a city like this baffles me a little bit, how do people not feel cramped? I worry that so many people may overwhelm me but I am lucky to have a new friend by my side though they expressed some concerns about potential prejudice due to their exotic appearance, and how much they missed their life in the 'Astral' sea, they say they used to be a sailor there. We met an odd little Rock Gnome jester by the name of Jink on the way into Ashtar. They started following us and cracking jokes, I guess we stood out. 

LahVander and myself took some time to explore the city with our new guide Jink who between jokes showed us around the marketplace. LahVander seems quite interested in the clothes and accessories for sale while I try to keep an eye out for anything that may be related to my vision. 

While we were exploring the market we heard someone cry out for help, their 4 prized pigs escaped their pen and were running through the streets. Jink was able to hop onto one and steer it back to the pen, I took the rope from my pack and tripped one then caught it while it tried to get up, and VahVander managed to just scoop one up then kiss it. An Eldrin walks up holding the forth and while addressing the owner signs stating that this keeps happening and Wilmstead needs to look after their pigs better. To thank us the owner of the pigs we now know as Wilmstead asked us to stop by tomorrow and they will reward us. 

We found an inn and and checked in, Jink has decided to join myself and LahVander for a while so they have checked into to the same Inn. We dined, drank and conversed with each other, If I'm to work with these two in the city I should get to know them better.

### Ishar 1st week to Maruk 2nd week of Pherusa 
The three of us have decided to do some jobs together while we conduct our own business in the city, LahVander is a Druid and so has joined me while we explore the environment around Ashtar doing some herb gathering and game hunting to trade for coin. Jink is a bard from Ashtar and so has some connections in the local taverns so they have been doing some entertainment work occasionally one of us will pick up some part time work with Jink at the taverns, either assisting in their 'show' or waiting tables. 

As I have gotten to know LahVander and Jink I've noticed some things about them. Though LahVander is an elf and respectful of nature they don't have much appetite, they tell me this is due to their time in the 'Astral'. I don't understand this wouldn't being a sailor be hungry work? Yet they seem more curious about food than anything else. Jink doesn't share much about themselves directly but they do know some old hunting songs, that said they would not make a good hunter much to noisy.
