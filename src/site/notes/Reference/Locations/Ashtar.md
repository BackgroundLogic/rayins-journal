**Region:** [[Reference/Locations/Plateau of Andorra\|Plateau of Andorra]]

The city of Ashtar sits at the highest point of the Planes, built atop the Plateau of Andorra. This placement is carefully considered, as the settlement was built to survey any trouble that might emerge from the Wildes on the other side of the southern border. Reaching the city requires navigating a series of winding switchback roads that climb up the various levels of the plateau.

Ashtar is known as “the city of bells” due to traditional defensive practices. The fey of the Planes greatly dislike the sound of bells, and to further deter attack from any rogue fey, Ashtar is surrounded by them. Strings of small bells line the light posts, fences, and gates of the city, causing the air to fill with jingling whenever a strong wind blows through. In addition to these decorative strings of bells, bell towers stationed throughout the city religiously herald each hour.

Perhaps the most interesting thing about Ashtar is the guardians who keep it safe. The city is home to a sect of magic-users called carillons who train in the use of magic bells to summon, banish, control, and battle fey creatures. A carillon is easily recognized by the bandolier of seven bells they wear. Carillons are influential and revered figures in the Planes, who act as skilled protectors and hunters of the worst fey predators in history. Still, they are also universally feared for the mysterious knowledge they possess.
