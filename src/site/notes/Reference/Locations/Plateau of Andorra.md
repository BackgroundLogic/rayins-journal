The Plateau of Andorra is a flat-topped mountain that dominates the southwestern region of the eldrin empire. The rocky lands around the base of the plateau directly border the uncharted realms of the Wildes.

#### Major Locations[](https://venture-maidens.fandom.com/wiki/Plateau_of_Andorra?veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Major Locations")

Ashtar is the only major settlement on the plateau, but scattered farming communities eke out survival in the lands at its base. These lands are the closest points to the edge of the empire, and a magical jungle marks the border.
